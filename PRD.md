Help me create a PRD for a web app in Elixir Phoenix Liveview with name "Sammelkarten" that looks like a blockchain coin chart like https://www.kraken.com/en-de/prices/bitcoin. But I want it much cleaner, minimalistic, and a beautiful app. Instead of Bitcoin I want to display collectible cards ("Sammelkarten) as coins with prices and development of the prices over the time. Each collectible card should have its own page with detailed information, including price history, rarity, and other relevant data. You can find images of each card in folder card_images.
